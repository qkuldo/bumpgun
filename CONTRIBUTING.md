## Issues
1. Creating an issue
   - If you find one, it is best you create an issue with the `bug` or `enhancement` tag and add it to the project's [_documentation sheet_][https://github.com/users/qkuldo/projects/1] in the **Bug Report** or **Feature Proposal** row. The workflow will automatically assign it to the `To-Do` column. Set the fields for `Assignees`, `Status`, and `Time Started`.
2. Working on an issue
   - You can move an issue to the `Working on it` column if you complete at least one of its sub-issues or if you create a commit linking to that bug reportin a separate branch.
3. Completing an issue
   - You can mark an issue as complete if you merge the branch you fixed the issue with to the `main` branch. You also have to link that pull request to the issue.

   - The short description of a Pull Request should be formatted in this way:
