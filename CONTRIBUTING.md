## Issues
1. Creating an issue
   - If you find one, it is best you create an issue with the `bug` or `enhancement` tag and add it to the project's [_documentation sheet_][https://github.com/users/qkuldo/projects/1] in the **Bug Report** or **Feature Proposal** row. The workflow will automatically assign it to the `To-Do` column. Set the fields for `Assignees`, `Status`, and `Time Started`.
2. Working on an issue
   - You can move an issue to the `Working on it` column if you complete at least one of its sub-issues or if you create a commit linking to that bug reporting a separate branch.
3. Completing an issue
   - You can mark an issue as complete if you merge the branch you fixed the issue with to the version branch it was based on. You also have to link that pull request to the issue.
## Pull Requests
1. Creating a Pull Request
   - The short description of a Pull Request should be formatted in this way:

2. Resolving a Pull Request
